    "To survive a client call, keep your 'I told you so' count above 0 while lowering theirs to 0. This is considered strategy.",
    "The ancient art of Multi-Touch Attribution has been debated by scholars for generations. Each platform claims sole credit for the conversion. None can be trusted. All demand more budget.",
    "If you start a scope creep you can't finish, try adding it to the next SOW. Your client just might forget they asked for it...",
    "Media Buyers are naturally armored throughout their body... with the exception of the ego. Try using QBR data to target this area, and defeat them before they get close enough to request more spend.",
    '"The best attribution models are passed on by the survivors." — Unknown Analyst, sometime before the iOS 14 apocalypse',
    'The Stakeholder is a fearsome creature that dwells in Slack\'s deepest channels. It regenerates scope when wounded, but is susceptible to calendar invites marked "Urgent."',
    "Your ROAS regenerates slowly over time, but can be instantly depleted by a single executive asking 'but what about brand awareness?' Conserve it wisely.",
    "The Agency floor lacks a unified government, and any institutional system of PTO approval. If you wrong a Project Manager, prepare to be CC'd on everything for eternity.",
    "Want to prevent a client from fleeing? Cripple their expectations early. A realistic forecast in Q1 will save your Q4.",
    "In the year 2021, the great Cookie collapsed, and the noble forces of the First-Party Data coalition waged constant war against an army of hideous Privacy Regulations. The outcome remains unclear. Check your dashboards.",
